# Lightweight SQLite binding for Ada

> This is my SQLite binding. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

See [example.adb](example/src/example.adb) and [sqlite.ads](src/sqlite.ads).
Not all API functions are exposed, only those needed for executing prepared
statements and reading results are implemented.
